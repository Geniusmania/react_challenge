## Development Approach

### Architecture & Design Principles

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Component Modularity**: Each UI element is encapsulated in focused, reusable components
- **State Management**: Uses React's built-in useState for local component state management
- **Design System**: Implements a consistent design system using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring optimal experience across all device sizes

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Interactive Skip Selection
- **Toggle Functionality**: Users can select and deselect skip options by clicking on cards or buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected items are highlighted with distinct styling (ring borders, color changes)
- **State Persistence**: Selection state is maintained throughout the user session

#### 2. Enhanced User Interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Multi-step progress indicator showing current position in the booking flow
- **Responsive Grid**: Adaptive layout that adjusts from single column on mobile to three columns on desktop

#### 3. Data-Driven Content
- **Feature Badges**: Clear indicators for road legality and heavy waste acceptance
- **Comprehensive Information**: Hire periods, pricing breakdowns, and container specifications

### Technical Implementation

#### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── SkipSelector.tsx      # Main container component
│   ├── SkipCard.tsx          # Individual skip display component
│   └── ProgressIndicator.tsx # Multi-step progress tracker
```

#### State Management Strategy
The application uses a simple but effective state management approach:
- `selectedSkip`: Tracks the currently selected skip ID (nullable for deselection)
- Toggle logic allows users to deselect by clicking the same item twice
- State changes trigger immediate UI updates with smooth transitions

#### Styling & UX Considerations
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and interactive element sizing
- **Performance**: Optimized images with appropriate sizing and compression
- **User Feedback**: Clear visual states for hover, selection, and disabled elements
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth transitions and scaling effects enhance user engagement
